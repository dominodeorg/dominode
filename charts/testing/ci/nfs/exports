# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported

# In this example:
# /exports/s3data is the native (node) folder to share
# 10.42.0.0/16 is CIDR IP Address of the cluster. In other words, the IP address range of the cluster. It might be different in your k8s distro.
# 192.168.100.6 is the node real machine IP Address. It is also needed because the route goes from pod to node to other node.
/exports/s3data		10.42.0.0/16(rw,root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check) 192.168.100.6(rw,root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
